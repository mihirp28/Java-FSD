## Practice Statement - E-commerce Application

**Sandra is a solopreneur. She owns an ecommerce website that sells every item for $10. To augment her sales, she is offering customers 1 free item for every 10 online purchases that they make during the month.**

**Jason likes the offer and wishes to spend $100 to purchase 10 items from the website. How many items will Jason get if he is able to make this purchase?**

**Write a program that takes as input the amount a customer wants to spend, price of each item and the number of items already purchased and displays the total number of items bought including the free items. Use recursive functions to perform the same.**


**Sample Input:**

    int moneySpent = 100 ;

    int priceOfAnItem = 10;
    
    int itemsAlreadyPurchased = 10 ; 

**Sample Output:**
    
    The total number of items (purchased + free items) : 11
