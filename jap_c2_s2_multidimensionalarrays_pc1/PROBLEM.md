## Practice Statement - Sum of Boundary Elements

**Write a Java program that helps identify the boundary elements of a two-dimensional matrix and calculates the sum of the boundary elements.**

**Sample Input**

    integerArray [][] = {{1, 2, 3, 4}, {4, 5, 6, 7}, {3, 6, 7, 8}, {5, 8, 9, 0}};

**Sample Output**

    The boundary elements of the matrix:
                        1 2 3 4
                        4     7
                        3     8
                        5 8 9 0

    The sum of boundary elements is 54.
