## Practice Statement: Aquarium Water pH Value

**The chemical formula of water is H2O (2 hydrogen atoms + 1 Oxygen atom). 
The term pH is a measure of the hydrogen-ion concentration in water.
The pH value ranges from 0 to 14, with 0 being the most acidic and 14 the most alkaline (basic). 
Neutral water has the pH value of 7.
For a goldfish to survive in an aquarium, the preferred pH value must range from 7 to 8.
The pH value of an aquarium may change from time to time.**

**Write a program that takes the pH value of the aquarium water as an input and displays one of the following results.**

    1.If the pH value is below 7, display “pH value is low, partial water change required”.
    2.If the value is in between 7 to 8, display “pH value is fine”.
    3.If the value is greater than 8, display “pH value is high, partial water change required”.



 if(phLevel<7) {
      return “pH value is low, partial water change required”;
  }
     else if(phLevel>=7 && phLevel<=8)
     { return “pH value is fine”;}
    	 else
    	 { return “pH value is high, partial water change required”;
}
