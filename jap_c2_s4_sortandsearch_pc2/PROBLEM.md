## Practice Statement - Quick Sort

**Caroline is from Chicago. She is looking forward to her 10 days trip to Switzerland. She has decided to make Zurich her base city and visit 8 cities every day from Zurich by doing day trips. She has a list of 10 cities and towns in Switzerland that she wants to cover but has to remove 2 out of the list as on the 10th day she has a flight back to Chicago. She has decided to sort the list based on the distance in kms of each city from Zurich.â€‹ Use Quick Sort to sort the distances.**
