## Practice Statement - Calculator

**Design a calculator application that will help perform mathematical and scientific
calculations. Listed below are the basic operations that are performed on the 
calculator.**

### Task 1:

#### Basic mathematical operations

1.Addition of integers and decimal numbers

2.Subtraction of integers and decimal numbers

3.Multiplication of integers and decimal numbers

4.Division of integers (Make sure that a number is not divided by zero. Handle the situation appropriately.)

5.Modulo of integers and decimal numbers

### Task 2:

#### Scientific calculations

1.Compute the ceil value

    If the value entered is 0 or negative, raise an alert
2.Compute the floor value number

    If the value entered is 0 or negative, raise an alert
3.Square root of a non-negative number

    The numbers taken as input must be non-negative. If the number entered is 0 or negative, raise an alert and handle the situation
4.Compute an exponential expression

    The base and exponent must be non-negative
    The base and exponent must not be zero


#### Note : Handle all exceptional scenarios.

#### Sample Input/Output

#### Mathematical calculator

    Enter the numbers a and b:

    23
    
    56

    The sum of 23.0 and 56.0 is : 79.0

    Enter a non-negative integer:
    
    3
    
    Enter a non-negative integer:
    
    4

    The value of 3 to the power 4 is 81

#### Scientific Calculator

    Enter a decimal number:
    
    0
    
    The number is zero
    
    calculator.CalculatorException


#### Hint:
Use appropriate exception handlers as and when required

Make use of the user-defined exception classes
