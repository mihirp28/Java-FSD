## Practice Statement - Insufficient Funds 

**David has a savings account in a bank. He believes he has sufficient money in his account
to make an investment. So, he signs a cheque of a certain amount that needs to be withdrawn
from his bank account. However, when he deposits the cheque in the bank to withdraw the 
aforesaid amount, the cheque is bounced due to insufficient funds. David receives a message 
from the bank stating, "Insufficient balance in the account.". Based on this scenario, 
write a program that introduces a withdrawal method that takes care of the withdrawal 
process and throws the user-defined exception named "InsufficientFundException", 
if insufficient funds are found.**
