## Practice Statement - Creating a Playlist

**We can create multiple playlists of our own in any music app. Workout, travel, meditation, etc., are some of the popular playlists that people create. Generally, songs in a playlist appear in a sequence. Once a particular song is over, the next song gets played automatically. A music app provides the following facilities to its users.**

1. Add a song at the beginning of a playlist
2. Display the number of songs in a particular playlist
3. Allows the user to go back and forth in a playlist
4. Delete any song from the playlist  
   
***Note : A song has the ‘name of the song’ and ‘the duration’***
